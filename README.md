You can define which port will be listen with an environment variable, eg: `PORT=3001`.

$ yarn compile
```

If you need to keep Webpack watching your changes add `-w`, eg: `yarn compile -w`.

> The Calendar App access the Pipefy's GraphQL API localy (in development environment), so you'll need to run the Pipefy App too (eg. `cd path/to/pipefy/ && rails s`).

```ruby
app = PlatformApp.find(1)
app.url = 'http://localhost:3001/manifest.json'
app.oauth_client_id = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID'
app.save!
```
